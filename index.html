          <p>Duelling Mythicals is a fantasy-themed, player vs. computer digital card game. Its core mechanic resembles 'rock paper scissors'.</p>

          <h3 id="instructions">How do I play it?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You and the computer will start with 25-card decks, containing 5 of each mythical creature.</li>
            <li>On each go, you will have a free choice of which creature to duel with, so long as there is at least 1 of it remaining in your deck.</li>
            <li>The computer will play a card randomly out of its remaining cards.</li>
            <li>Your individual wins, losses, and draws will be remembered while the game is in progress. An overall victory, stalemate, or defeat will be calculated from them.</li>
          </ul>
